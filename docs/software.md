## PyDESeq2

[PyDESeq2](https://github.com/owkin/PyDESeq2) is a python implementation of the DESeq2 method for differential expression analysis (DEA) with bulk RNA-seq data. I supervised the project and took part in code reviews.

## Substra

[Substra](https://github.com/substra/substra) is an open source federated learning (FL) software that was developed by Owkin to enable secure collaborations across hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.
While I did not contribute to the substra core, I worked on an internal FL library that led to the current [SubstraFL](https://github.com/substra/substrafl) component, which provides high-level abstractions that are more amenable to ML practitioners.

## Kymatio

[Kymatio](https://www.kymat.io/) is an implementation of the wavelet scattering transform in Python that efficiently leverages GPUs. I have primarily contributed to the 1D initial implementation of kymatio, as a byproduct of my PhD.
